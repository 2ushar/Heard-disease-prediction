implemented 4 different classifier algorithms( KNN Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier) to predict whether a person has a heart disease  or not.
Imported data of more than 300 samples in CSV format and analyzed using Matplotlib and Scikit learn.
In the end K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 84 % with 8 nearest neighbors.
